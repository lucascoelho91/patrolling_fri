2) Move base client is not publishing
-- Complete steps to reproduce the bug
Run segway_gazebo and after that, run the mpoints. Seems that it calls the service but it doesn't publish to move_base/goal and never answers back so the planner is not receiving the goal and program is stuck in the waiting for the response

-- expected behavior
Something should haD been published to move_base/goal and the robot should change the plans

-- observed (buggy) behavior
Nothing is published to move_base/goal

-- Fixed?
nops

1) Segmentation fault at start

-- Complete steps to reproduce the bug
Just run it

-- expected behavior
No segmentation error

-- observed (buggy) behavior
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

-- Fixed?
Yup
   --- Cause?
	It was actually the path of the executable. When you run rosrun, it runs the node using the current folder in the terminal as the current directory. That's why. I fixed this problem calling rosrun inside the package folder. But I thik I should get the directory name of the node.
